/*
The idea here is to simulate processing data and logging
of eacg process of data.
The processing of data and logging is split into two workers,
where each have it's own queue.
Each time new data is placed on the pipeline, the same data
will be put on both the data channel and the log channel. But
if the log channel is full, a message will be printed in the
console.
On purpose the routine that reads logs is given a delay, so it
will not work as fast as the one who handles data, to simulate
hickup's in the logging system.
