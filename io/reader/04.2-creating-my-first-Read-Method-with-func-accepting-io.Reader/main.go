/*
The purpose of this program is to test creating a Read Method who follows the rule for Read methods,
by taking a []byte as input, and returning n characters read, and an error telling when done or failed.

We will create a new type called storage, which can hold some data of type string
The storage type shall have a read method, to read the content of the storage into a variable.
There shall also be a function to create and initialize a new storage (will be done in next version)

Since our new type has a Read method, it will also satisfy the interface io.Reader. We will create another read-something function
which takes an io.Reader as input to demonstrate that we can now use myStorage as input where it is asked for io.Reader as input type.

This function will take a type string as input, and create a new variable of type *myStorage, filled with the string.
It will take the string, put it into the 'data' field of the myStorage struct,
and return a pointer to that new struct with the 'data' variable set to the value of the string given as input with sData.
The returning variable will be of type *myStorage, which contains the field data set to the content of sData.
The returned variable can then be assigned to a new variable, and we have by that created a new storage.

		TEST3 :
		Since we've created a Read method for 'myStorage' with the same input argument, and return values as the Read method defined in
		the io.Reader interface 'Read(p []byte)(n int, err error)', then myStorage becomes accepted as a valid type for the io.Reader interface which also
		is a type.
		Since io.Reader now accepts the type myStorage we can create a new readStorage function with the same code used in the Read loops in TEST1 & TEST2,
		but instead of using input type myStorage for the new readStorage function we can use input type io.Reader, since myStorage now is also an io.Reader.

		When we call readStorage which takes an oi.Reader, and pass it a type of 'myStorage' as input, it will use the Read method that is defined
		with 'myStorage'.
		If we for example called readStorage with a 'myBrandNewOtherType' or 'http' as input, that would also work, as long as they have a Read method.
		If we used a type http with readStorage, then http's Read method found in the http package would be used.
